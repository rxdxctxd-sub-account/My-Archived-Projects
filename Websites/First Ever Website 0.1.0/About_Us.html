			<h2> <font size="4">c:> Courses_we_recommend.txt</font></h2>
			<p> We have various courses that you can look at if your wanting to become a web developer for us or even just on your own this is a small list of some courses and videos that can guide your way.</p>			
			<h3> <font size="3">Khan Academy</font></h3>
			<p>link: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css</p>
			<p>This is a really good beginner course. To be honest I would advise this to all people in which want to get into the web creation industry as it really does just act like you know nothing and while not extremely in-depth it will definitely get you through the basics so that you are able to create a good looking website in the quickest time possible. It is also extremely interactive which helps with the learning aspect.</p>
			<h3> <font size="3">Codecademy</font></h3>
			<p>link: https://www.codecademy.com/</p>
			<p>This quite a traditional course layout but definitely well designed and out of the three is more geared towards the more professional side of the industry whereas the other two seem to just cap beginners and can miss some gaps. This is definitely something that should even be on current web developers list of courses to look through as it really does go indepth. Not to say it does not support newbies to the world of web creation but I would advise you try one of the others first just so you have some knowledge.</p>
			<h3><font size="3">freeCodeCamp</font></h3>
			<p>link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg</p>
			<p>Of the three options this is by far a really good option if you learn visually over interaction or reading. This is mainly because you are shown by an actual person how the code works. This is especially important considering the fact that some tutorials seem to just feel unnatural but this tutorial truly feels like you are being taught by a teacher if that is your prefrence.</p>
			<br>
			<p> Those sum up our favorite learning resources to get mroe involved in the web creation industry. Please try out all of them and find which one helps you the best learn.</p>
